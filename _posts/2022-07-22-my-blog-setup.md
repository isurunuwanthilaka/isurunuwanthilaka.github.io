Up to this date I have tried few things to write on.

First, I started with Quora, but after wrting 100+ answers on it, I thought to focus on few thing valuable but not many things short and invaluable. Then I moved on.

Next, I moved to Medium. I still post some of these articles on it.

Then, I thought to write it my own in Github Pages. I found this more simple and easy.

First, I created a jekyll site with minima theme and did some customization. After few month, I found it cluttered by trying to filiing up more on to the site.

Then, I went to React on Github Pages as it is easy for me to style, but after complete revamp, I found it is hard for me to write articles.

Then again, reverted to Jekyll on Github Pages. And I made it pretty simple and minimalistic.

Now I write my articles directly online with vscode.dev

This is good for now.
