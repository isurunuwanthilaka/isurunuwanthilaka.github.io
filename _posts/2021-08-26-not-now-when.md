Life is too short, in this pandemic period no one needs an explanation for why. You can be at your early days of your life or middle age or may be at the retirement, that doesn't matter, your are few steps away from the hands of devil.

If not now, then when will be the right time to re-think about the life?.

##### Story

Through out the last few weeks , I had few ideas flooding my mind? "Isuru, are you ready to leave this life?" and I was wandering what if I have to. Even I have no garuntee that I am all safe. I am like you, like everyone - no super powers at all.

Talking truth, my saul talking loud says 'not yet'. So my question is why? Am I that much attached to this life- not clear.

I am sure I am not alone in this sense as buddha said "Every living being loves life and fears death".

##### Another approach to life?

So we can't get away from this fear, unless we understand the values of life. Actually the problem is what are the things we define valueble as in our lives.

At my age (of 26), normally what I tend to see valuable is education, profession, house, car or relationships I have or had, close friends and family. But the issue is all these are out of my controll or atleast less controll. You might argue that my education is solely my resposibility , but is this a valid point in this pandemic. No right!

So what if we can detach from atleast few things which are not that much important or less valuable in life?

Yes, we need a house to live, car to drive but should we live for them, no right? we don't need to. same applies to friends, family and realationships to 'some extend'.

The only way to live life to fullest is defining the 'inside' or 'me' or 'the mighty mind'. It is the hardest and core issue we all have and the barrer we are separated from the 'happiness'.

I think, the only valuable things are in mind, physical world is much fragile and temporary - but not going to buddhist philosophy here.

##### Clearing thoughts!

So how can peel off the unnessary stuff from the life and keep only the things what we want?

Following questions will help to enhance the value of life?

1. What will be the things I would be proud at my death bed? Have I started those things already?

2. What are the fears I have? Are those real? FTW, build 'I don't care' mind set.

3. Am I proud of what I am doing right now? No - change it now.

4. Am I just wasting my life without a purpose? Find the purpose - atleast try to find.

In my case, I have nothing much to achieve, I am happy about the current snapshot of my life and the way I live is enough. But I think I should more focus on streaching my mind bit more.

Time is limited. Sooner the better.

_This is some random thoughts - no proper order or structure._
