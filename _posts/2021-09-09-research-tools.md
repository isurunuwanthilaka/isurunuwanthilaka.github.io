Yeah, I am bit excited about this `research thing` as this is the first time I am doing an academic research alone. The best part is my supervisor guiding me through to simplify the things which I am not supposed to spend hours struggling.

So in this post I will be showing my tool setup for research stuffs and will be adding more things later to keep this stack updated.

### Tools

1. Mendeley

2. $$\LaTeX$$ - MacTex and Overleaf

3. Google Docs

4. Github
