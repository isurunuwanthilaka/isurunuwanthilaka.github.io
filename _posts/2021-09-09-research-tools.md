Yeah, I am bit excited about this `research` thing as this is the first time I am doing an academic research alone. The better part is my supervisor guiding me through to simplify the things which I am not supposed to spend hours struggling.

so in this post I will be showing my tool setup for research stuff and will be adding things later to keep this stack updated.

### Tools

1. Mendley

2. $$\LaTeX$$ - MacTex and Overleaf

3. Google Docs

4. Github
