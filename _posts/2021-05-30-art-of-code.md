Early days of programming was composing 1s and 0s somehow to tell the machines a computational task. But now it has evolved
to a point that it is no longer a 1s and 0s dance. Now project teams are huge and lots of programmers working on same code base.
*So these days what matters most is how to write a code readable and surely someone would fix it to work on a machine.* Therefore,
coding has become an art.

What is an art in a general way?

**Poetry is a peace of art.**

: *well thought*
: *elegant language used*
: *idea is clear*
: *readers feel cared,loved while reading*
: *no unnecessary words, not even a single one*
: *written with passion*
