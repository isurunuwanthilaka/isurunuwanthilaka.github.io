title: I completed my second year as a Software Engineer!
---

I thought to continue this `I completed my X year as a Software Engineer!` series so I can see
how I am growing older in my career. Earlier I wrote [I completed my first year as a Software Engineer!](2021-04-12-1st-year-as-se.md).

I concluded my second year in SE on March 02, 2022. So this is a much over due talk ðŸ˜….

This year was a thriving one, having much experience in both engineering and business perspectives.

**What I did in this year?** ðŸ¥³

- Got to L4.
  
- Completed my first year in Masters Degree ðŸŽ“.
  
- Challenged myself with new tech stack, tools and concepts.

**Being competent**

When you start to get busy with coding, it distracts you from your learning. Sometimes we complete
project after project - yes, at first it will give some experience ,but after few projects on same
stack, we just doing same thing again and again. Therefore we need to be careful about what we are
doing and spend some time on sharpening the skills. May be, you can dig more on DSA or Data Science
or whatever you like.This year I spent learning Advanced Algorithms and more time on hackerrank. It
helped me to pass few interviews also.

**Writing more cleaner code**

This year, I have been pushed forward to the core parts of the code bases. Previously I managed few
separate services for a large project, but none cared much about the code quality. Mostly I did everything all alone. But now I work with few other engineers and keeping the consistency matters. From the beginning,
I was concerned about clean code, now I am seeing the real benefits of it. Day by day, I am trying to
code more cleaner. This year, I touched few more clean code concepts.

**Writing tests to be confident (tdd)**

I am starting to see why tests are important. In some previous projects, sometimes an error has no harm.
It may block user experience to some extend but nothing disastrous. But now I am mostly work related to
payments and every steps has a cost. A wrong payment with scare users and will make a bad impression to the system. So how I gain confidence in my code ? ***tests, no other way.*** . Now most of the things I write has a unit test. So I have a prove of my work. That make me more stress free and system bug free.

**Learning something new everyday**

I started learning guitar ðŸŽ¸ this year. Why? I wanted to learn something outside my comfort zone. I'm still trying to play few cords ðŸ˜‡. Other than that, I always spent some time reading articles written by the seniors in the field.

**Finding a balance**

With growing responsibilities, now I am staring to thing about work-life balance. I spent most of the days coding for hours last year. But this year I started to reduce the coding time and stick to workout everyday. Also blocked some time for reading and gaming with friends. I think , that way I can be more sustainable in the long run.

Next year, I want to organize my work more and block more time for my personal things.

Anyhow, still I am happy and coding thriving for me.
