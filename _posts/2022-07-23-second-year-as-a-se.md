title: I completed my second year as a Software Engineer!
---

I thought to continue this `I completed my X year as a Software Engineer!` series so I can see
how I am growing older in my career. Earlier I wrote [I completed my first year as a Software Engineer!](2021-04-12-1st-year-as-se.md).

I concluded my second year in SE on March 02, 2022. So this is a much over due talk ðŸ˜….

This year was a thriving one, having much experience in both engineering and business perspectives.

**What I did in this year?** ðŸ¥³

- Got to L4.
  
- Completed my first year in Masters Degree.
  
- Challenged myself with new tech stack, tools and concepts.

**Being competent all the time**

**Writing more cleaner code**

**Writing tests to be confident (tdd)**

**Learning something new everyday**

**Making many friends**

**Finding a balance**
