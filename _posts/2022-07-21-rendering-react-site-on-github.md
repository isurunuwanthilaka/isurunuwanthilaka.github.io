title: Rendering React client-side app on Github Pages
---

I was keen about how we can deploy simple react app to Github Pages.

I had already seen more sites with Jekyll.

By exploring, I saw now we have `gh-pages` bundle which creates the build to deploy on Github Pages.

For my react apps, I created this https://github.com/isurunuwanthilaka/react-app template, so I can reuse. You can find the simple script commands in package.json and also need to change some meta data in package.json when deploying.

Sample app I created -> [My Salary App](https://isurunuwanthilaka.github.io/my-salary/)

We can do lot more things with Github Pages/ Github Actions
