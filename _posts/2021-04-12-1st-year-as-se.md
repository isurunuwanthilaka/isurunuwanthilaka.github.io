Becoming a software engineer is an exciting journey. It has made me fascinated about the world. Talking truth, I have
lots of things to learn yet, but I thought it is worth noting some facts I have found at the end of the first year into
software engineering.

## Some self-talk

I know It is just a one year, no big deal. Still I am motivated and in a rapid learning phase. So I have challenging 
work every day and feel improving,important and expanding. Comparing to the starting point and the end point of 2020,
I feel like I have become less passionate (nah, not saying I am completely demotivated) I think it is because I am learning
the real nature of the corporate world. It is hard to make the `change` in an already fixed systems.

## Things taken to second year

#### 1. It is important to have a mentor

Not all the supervisors are `good` mentors. If you focus on a career , it is important to have a mentor irrespective of the
salary you get. These are the years we lay our `foundation` we don't know how far we go, but we should be ready with a
solid foundation to endure anything coming in the future.

I am lucky I found a good mentor (I think so...), why I say he is good?

* He is updated. He is still learning and has a growth mind set.

* He knows career growth is also important rather than just finishing the projects.

* He gives the directions, but I should find the solutions, fixes and suggestions for enhancing the systems.

* Open for discussions - We talk about technologies, new features and evaluate how those fit to ours and should we use those.

* I can do `dumb stuff`, he allows me to do R&D, test and play with servers if I think that technology is important.

* He provides the support for project work -  (this is what I am paid for.)

* Pushing to the next step - In the small projects or POCs, I have involved in the designing of databases, systems or architecting
CICD pipelines. In this stage, I think it is a rare opportunity to involve in the designing.
  
* He is good-tempered even at hard times.

#### 2. Less is more. Done is 'done done', not almost done.

#### 3. Automate repetitive tasks.

#### 4. Write clean code.

#### 5. Learn. Learn. Learn.
