title: Catching up Latex
---

Recently I explored the $$\LaTeX$$ as I am starting to work on my MSc research. And yes, I am falling into love with it, because of its simplicity , elegant look and the easy to format - or may be I am an engineer, coding all the day.

I found several free ways to use it.

One is to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), it is a standard tool these days. It can be used if you are working with other collaborator but most of advanced features are bundled with premium package. It good to have a look at it and start straightaway.

But in my case I want to keep a track of the file versions and ability to work offline. So I searched for ways to set it up on my machine. Fortunately there is good mixture with latex,vs-code and git which provides my initial requirements. One bad thing we have to install packages overselves, but worth the effor I think.

### Installing

There is no rocket science here. Just got to [mactex](http://tug.org/mactex/) which is the flavor of latex for MacOS. Next get the [Latex workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extention added to the VS code editor. And you might need to upgrade perl and its packages using brew and cpan. I had to resolve few issues with formatter.

### Learning

It is easy. Just check this [30-minute guide on overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) and play with it a little bit, it is just another scripting language. You can find varius types of templetes on Overleaf. Just download, open in vs-code and compile. Simply play with it, you can learn. It took me only few hours while writing the literature review.

### Blogging

Then I wanted to know how to add latex math to my jekyll site. It is even simpler. Just follow [https://cullaloe.com/render-latex-in-jekyll/](https://cullaloe.com/render-latex-in-jekyll/) and you can add mathematics formulas in latex style with the help of katex bundle.

Look at this, isn't it beautiful?

$$\LaTeX$$ is cool tool, I am sure it is good to add it to your tool box.
