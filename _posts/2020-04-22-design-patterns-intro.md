Software engineer is no other than civil engineer, but with a different context. Both build structures may be small scale and large scale. Therefore, software engineers need careful design both conceptual and technical before jumping into coding phase. Over the course of software engineering career, we can see same engineering problem patterns appearing again and again. So how about we implementing a template for solving that particular issue re-occurring. That is hoe the design patterns enter to the software world. So, with design patterns we can come up with flexible, re-usable and easy to maintain solutions to our software problems.
