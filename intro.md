## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate `Software Engineer` from Sri Lanka.

I code in `Java` , `Golang` and `Python`. Developing `microservices` is my main task at work, also I use `Docker` for CI/CD and `Postgres` for databasing. Designing and learning new technologies is what I enjoy most. I do many side projects :) in free time. 

When I am not sticking to a screen , I might be doing reading, meditation or over thinking about something - yeah, about anything.

All the thoughts are my very own!
