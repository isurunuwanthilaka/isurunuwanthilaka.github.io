{: style="text-align: justify" }
I am a passionate fullstack Software Engineer.

I code in Java (Springboot),React.JS, Golang and Python.Writing Microservices is my main task at work, apart from that docker and postgres play key role in my daily tasks.

I do many side projects :) in free time. Designing, building android apps, developing bots, telco app etc.

When I am not coding , I do reading, meditation or over thinking about something - yeah, about anything.

All the thoughts are my very own!
